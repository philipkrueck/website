title: "Redirecting Output in Nushell"

I've recently switched my default shell to [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) in an attempt to bring type safety and to my shell experience. This has been a big win so far, but there are some downsides to Nushell.

While a deliberate design decision, not all POSIX shell operations can be translated directly to Nushell.
Today, I learned that the standard redirection operator `>` has a different meaning.

I wanted to deploy a simple nginx pod to my Kubernetes home lab.
Using the `--dry-run=client` flag, I aimed to generate and then edit the resulting YAML file:

```sh
kubectl run nginx-yaml --image=nginx --dry-run=client -oyaml > nginx.yaml
```

This operation silently failed. In other shells such as `bash` or `zsh`, the above command would redirect the stdout YAML to the file `nginx.yaml`.

However, running the same command in Nushell prints the following to stdout:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: nginx-yaml
  name: nginx-yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - '>'
    - out.yaml
    image: nginx
    name: nginx-yaml
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

Interestingly, even though the `>` redirection operator doesn't exist in Nushell, the command actually succeeds.

Let's explore why that is the case.

The `>` is treated as a raw argument to the `kubectl run` command. So ">" and "out.yaml" become arguments of the `kubectl run` command and hence become part of the generated YAML spec. `kubectl` was expecting an argument for the entrypoint in `spec.container.args` after the `--image` flag.

I then learned to pipe to Nushells built-in `save` command, rather than using the familiar Unix redirection patterns:

```nu
k run nginx-yaml --image=nginx --dry-run=client -oyaml | save nginx.yaml
```

Let me know if you've encountered similar curiosities when working with Nushell.
