Here's my process I go through when starting a new course in order to start off on the right foot:

- [ ] Pay tuition
- [ ] Make sure I have access to Canvas & Edstem
- [ ] Join Slack channel & Discord server for the course
- [ ] Introduce myself on Edstem (There is usually an introduction thread)
- [ ] Download Lecture videos
- [ ] Create Notion page for course
- [ ] Read syllabus and course schedule (add stuff to Notion)
- [ ] Check online reviews for course for tips to succeed (e.g. coolstercodes & omscentral)
- [ ] Create personal strategy for the course

Did I miss anything?
