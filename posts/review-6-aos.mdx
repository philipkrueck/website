## What the Course Is About

This course is the natural evolution of [CS6200](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems) aka GIOS.
Many students (including myself) took GIOS prior to AOS.
GIOS tackles the core concepts of operating systems like processes, threads, memory management, CPU scheduling & file systems.
AOS gives a brief refresher on these topics at the start of the course, but then dives into some more advanced topics including:
- Dynamic Resource Allocation in Virtualized Environments
- [Barrier Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)) Algorithms in Parallel Systems
- Distributed Memory & File Systems
- Parallel Data Processing ([MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce))
- [Content Delivery Networks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/)
- Failure & Recovery in Distributed Systems
- Security

## Personal Note

I have taken this course in the Spring semster of 2024 along with [AI](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence).
Prior to this course I have taken [GIOS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems), [DBS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6400-database-systems-concepts-and-design), [CN](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks) & [AIES](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6603-ai-ethics-and-society).

### Pre-Lab

This pre-lab acts as a readiness test for the upcoming projects.
The objective is to find a handful of bugs in a multi-threaded C program.
The program makes use of the [`pthreads`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html) library 
as well as mutexes to implement a simple producer-consumer queue.
If you've worked with `pthreads` and mutexes before, the prelab will be an easy refresher.

Time spent: ~3 hours

### Homework

The homework asks a bunch of free-form response questions on core OS concepts including 
virtual memory, paging, segmentation, I/O management, process context switching and the OSI model.
If you've taken GIOS or a similar OS course, this homework will be a breeze.

Time spent: ~2.5 hours

### Projects

The projects in this course are hard, rewarding, fun, well-designed and for me by far the best part of this course.
If you liked the GIOS projects, these are on-par or even better.
For all projects you're provided with starter code and a solid set of instructions.
AFAIK, the projects aren't open-sourced anywhere.

#### Project 1: Virtual Machine Scheduling

In this project you implement a virtual CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to dynamically manage
resources for virtual machines.
[KVM](https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) is used as a hypervisor on top of an Ubuntu Linux environment to run guest VMs.
The implementation uses the [`libvirt`](https://libvirt.org/) library to interact with the hypervisor.

The goal of the scheduler is to pin VMs to physical CPUs (pCPUs) such that the
resulting standard deviation of pCPU usages is less than some threshold.
In other words, the scheduler balances the load of the VMs equally across the pCPUs.
The task is an instance of the classic [bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem).
I opted for a variation of [first fit decreasing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-fit-decreasing_bin_packing) where the VMs 
represent items and the pCPUs represent bins.

For the memory coordinator implementation you're tasked to implement a [baloon driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ballooning) to 
dynamically adjust the memory allocation of each VM.
My implementation calculates the memory change between iterations as well as remaining free memory
to decide whether to increase or decrease memory for each VM. I found the specific decision boundaries
through trial and error to arrive at a solution which is generalizable across different
VM/CPU configurations and memory pressure scenarios.

Overall, I found this project challenging, but very doable.

Time spent: ~20 hour

#### Project 2: Barrier Algorithms

The goal of this assignment is to implement multiple [barrier algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)) 
that synchronize between threads and machines. Furthermore, benchmark testing of the implementation is performed
by scaling the number of cores and threads.

For this project we were able to work in groups of 2, but could also go solo.
I decided to partner up and am happy I did as we could work independently on separate parts.
Tbh, I don't think I would have been able to finish the project in time otherwise.

The project itself is directly inspired by the paper ["Algorithms for scalable synchronization on shared-memory multiprocessors"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/103727.103729).
The implementation of the algorithms is done in C using the [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) and [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) libraries.
Basically, OpenMP is used for the thread synchronization and Open MPI for machine synchronization.
The experiments are run by submitting jobs to Georgia Tech's ["Instructional Cluster Environment"](https://gatech.service-now.com/technology?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0042102).
We wrote some custom Python scripts to automate the test generation and the visualization of the results.

In conclusion, this project was an absolute grind.
The biggest time sinks included: finding subtle bugs in the barrier implementation,
dealing with long feedback loops of experiments on the cluster and writing up the report.

Time spent: ~35 hours

#### Project 3: Distributed gRPC service

In this project you build a distributed [async gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/async/) service 
in C++ that uses a [thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool) to make asynchronous requests.
It mimics an online shop like Amazon which fetches price information for a product from multiple vendors.

Like in project 2, you can team up with a partner. I chose to build this one on my own as I didn't 
see much potential for splitting work.

The main challenge is setting up async gRPC and implementing a threadpool.
The remaining parts of coding out the service are pretty straightforward if you're familiar with gRPC.

If you've taken GIOS and/or know gRPC, this project will feel like a breather compared to project 2.

Time spent: ~10 hours

#### Project 4: MapReduce

Project 4 requires you to implement a simplified version of the [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) framework.

Once again, partnering up is an option. I collaborated with the same partner from project 2.
It was easy to split work and we could mostly work independently on separate parts.

For the project itself, you are provided with starter code which scaffolds out the framework.
One major challenge is to implement the communciation protocol between the master and worker nodes.
This is facilitated by the gRPC library which should be fresh from project 2.
MapReduce is technically a distributed system with independent worker nodes, 
but for this project we only implement a single node version where nodes are simulated by locally running processes.

This was my favorite project of the course.
I found it rewarding to see the framework come together.
And, it wasn't a grind like project 2.

Time spent: ~15 hours

### Tests

The testing approach in AOS is unique. The format involves pre-releasing 80% of the actual test questions.
This provides students with the opportunity to collaboratively answer the questions in a shared document.
Usually, within one day of the test deadline, students reach a consensus on the correct answers for most questions.
A few students - probably less than 10 - really shoulder the workload by contributing all the answers.
The rest of the class, myself included, just piggybacked on their work for test prep.

The final test environment is proctored and closed notes. The remaining 20% of unreleased questions
I found to be fair and representative of the course material for all 3 tests.
The test itself is then closed notes, closed internet and proctored.

My study strategy was minimalist—I watched the lectures once and then 
loaded the widely accepted answers into my memory just before the test.

#### Test 1

Test 1 covers the first 4 lectures of the course:

- Lecture 1: Intro to AOS
- Lecture 2: OS structures
- Lecture 3: Virtualization
- Lecture 4: Parallel Systems

#### Test 2

Test 2 covers the next set of 3 lectures:

- Lecture 5: Distributed Systems
- Lecture 6: Distributed Objects & Middleware
- Lecture 7: Distributed Subsystems

#### Test 3

Test 3 covers the remaining 4 lectures:

  - Lecture 8: Failures & Recovery
  - Lecture 9: Internet Computing
  - Lecture 10: RT & Multimedia
  - Lecture 11: Secturity

### Paper Summaries

2% of your grade comes from summarizig 2 research papers.
I didn't do this part as as I signed up too late when all the nice papers were already taken.
If you want to do the paper summaries, I would recommend signing up early.

### Class Participation

Class participation is based on activity on Ed Discussions.
The couse staff don't disclose how they grade this part. 
I believe it's a function of the number of posts and upvotes.
I only wrote 2 posts on Ed Discussions and got 100% for this part.

### Grading Curve

The course grading is on a curve. Here's the distribution for Spring 24' (not much of a curve):
- A: >= 90%
- B: >= 80%
- C: >= 64%
- D: >= 55%
- F: <  55%

### My Grades

  - *Test 1*: 93%
  - *Test 2*: 81%
  - *Test 3*: 79%
  - *Paper Summaries*: 0% (didn't do it)
  - *Class Participation*: 100%
  - *CIOS boost*: +0.5% (for entire class)

## The Course Materials

### Lectures

The course curriculum doesn't follow a textbook, 
choosing instead to present a series of research papers in video format.
The volume of lecture material is substantial, far more than any other course I've taken.

While some of the content is cool, I found a fair amount of the topics to be a bit antiquated.
Covering influential older research is great, but I would have liked to see more cutting-edge content.

[Prof. Ramachandran](https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Kishore.Ramachandran/homepage.html), the course lecturer, 
is engaging and clearly enthusiastic about the topics.
However, I found his delivery to be a bit repetitive which made the videos longer than necessary.

The lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTObrKKbRww&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPkKfusBLVfklgfdcB3BNpwX).

### Research Papers

The sheer amount of research papers assigned is overwhelming. 
Further, given the complex nature of operating systems, these papers usually aren't light reading.
My engagement with them was limited to skimming a few rather than reading for depth.
For sake of learning, I do regret not having more time to delve into the more interesting ones.

However, I think it's entirely possible to get a perfect grade without touching a single paper.

## Personal Opinion on AOS

### My Background going into the course

I had a solid background in operating systems by taking GIOS prior.
Further, I have a decent C programming background from [reading all of K&R](https://github.com/philipkrueck/the-c-programming-language-2nd-edition-solutions).

However, I suck at C++ and probably know less than 1% of its syntax.
For the purposes of this course, knowing C and some programming concepts from other languages was good enough
to get through the projects.

### How Hard Was The Course

I found the projects to be moderately hard, exams relatively low effort and the papers overwhelming.
Compared to other courses I've taken so far, I would rank AOS as one of the harder courses.
I would stack rank it as harder than AIES, DBS & CN, but similar in difficulty to GIOS and AI.

### What I Liked

- Projects are great
- Use of gRPC for projects 3 & 4
- Learned to implemented algorithms directly from research papers

### What I Disliked

- Outdated lecture videos
- Not much cutting-edge content
- Completely unrealistic amount of papers to get through in a single semester

### Should You Take This Class

- *You're looking for an easy course with minimal workload.* Don't take this course.
- *You liked GIOS and want to implement similar projects?* Go for it!

### How I Would Approach The Course If I Were To Take It Again

- Focus on the projects - they provide a high percentage of the grade & most of the learning
- Watch the lecture videos for key concepts and high level understanding
- Grind the 80% of pre-released questions for the tests
- Find a partner for project 2 and 4
